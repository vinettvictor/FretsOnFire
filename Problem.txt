Miyako came to the flea kingdom with a ukulele. She became good friends with local flea residents and played beautiful music for them every day.

In return, the fleas made a bigger ukulele for her: it has n strings, and each string has (1018+1) frets numerated from 0 to 1018. The fleas use the array s1,s2,…,sn to describe the ukulele's tuning, that is, the pitch of the j-th fret on the i-th string is the integer si+j.

Miyako is about to leave the kingdom, but the fleas hope that Miyako will answer some last questions for them.

Each question is in the form of: "How many different pitches are there, if we consider frets between l and r (inclusive) on all strings?"

Miyako is about to visit the cricket kingdom and has no time to answer all the questions. Please help her with this task!

Formally, you are given a matrix with n rows and (1018+1) columns, where the cell in the i-th row and j-th column (0=j=1018) contains the integer si+j. You are to answer q queries, in the k-th query you have to answer the number of distinct integers in the matrix from the lk-th to the rk-th columns, inclusive.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (1=n=100000) — the number of strings.

The second line contains n integers s1,s2,…,sn (0=si=1018) — the tuning of the ukulele.

The third line contains an integer q (1=q=100000) — the number of questions.

The k-th among the following q lines contains two integers lk,rk (0=lk=rk=1018) — a question from the fleas.

Output
Output one number for each question, separated by spaces — the number of different pitches.
